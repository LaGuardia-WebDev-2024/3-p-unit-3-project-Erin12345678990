<h2><strong class="bigsteps">Marcarpone cream</strong></h2></center>

  <p><strong class="smallsteps">Step 1:</strong> Whisk the mascarpone cheese on medium speed for 30-60 seconds until creamy.Scrape the bowl and set aside 
   </p>
   <p><strong class="smallsteps">Step 2:</strong>In a separate heat-proof bowl, add the egg yolks and ⅔ cup sugar. Boil 1-2" of water in a saucepan and reduce heat to the lowest setting. Place the bowl with egg yolks and sugar on top of the saucepan such that the water does not touch the bottom of the bowl. This is a double boiler. Whisk on medium-high speed for exactly 2 minutes, then remove from heat. The mixture will be light and fluffy. Do not overmix or overheat as it can become grainy*</p>

   <p><strong class="smallsteps">Step 3:</strong> In a separate bowl, whip the cold heavy cream until it reaches medium stiff peaks (just starts to hold shape). Do not overmix</p>

   <p><strong class="smallsteps">Step 4:</strong> Add the whipped cream to the mascarpone mixture in 2-3 additions, folding gently with a rubber spatula and taking care not to knock out the air. You will have a creamy, light mixture</p>

   <center><h2><strong class="bigsteps">Egg white version(Assembly is the same!):</strong></h2></center>

  <p><strong class="smallsteps"> Step 1:</strong> Whisk the mascarpone cheese on medium speed for 30-60 seconds until creamy. Scrape the bowl and set aside</p>

<p><strong class="smallsteps">Step 2:</strong> In a separate heat-proof bowl, add the egg yolks and ⅓ cup sugar. Boil 1-2" of water in a saucepan and reduce heat to the lowest setting. Place the bowl with egg yolks and sugar on top of the saucepan such that the water does not touch the bottom of the bowl. This is a double boiler. Whisk on medium-high speed for exactly 2 minutes, then remove from heat. The mixture will be light and fluffy. Do not overmix or overheat as it can become grainy*</p>

<p><strong class="smallsteps">Step 3:</strong> Pour the egg yolk and sugar mixture onto the mascarpone cheese. Add salt and vanilla, then whisk on medium speed just until combined, scraping the bowl halfway (do not overmix as the mixture can become grainy)</p>

<p><strong class="smallsteps">Step 4:</strong> In a separate clean bowl, add the egg whites and remaining ⅓ cup sugar. Place on the saucepan with boiling water again, and whisk on medium-high speed with a clean whisk until the mixture reaches 160F (5-8 minutes). Remove from heat and keep whisking until a glossy, stiff meringue forms*</p>

<p><strong class="smallsteps">Step 5:</strong>Add the meringue to the mascarpone mixture in 2-3 additions, folding gently with a rubber spatula and taking care not to knock out the air. You will have an airy, light mixture</p>

   <p><strong class="assombly">Assembly:</strong> 
    Pour the coffee into a wide bowl, and make sure it is not hot. Dip each ladyfinger quickly into the coffee (I do a quick dip on each side)* and add a layer of soaked ladyfingers in the bottom of a 8x9.5" rectangular dish*
    Spread on half of the mascarpone cream evenly<br>
Repeat with another layer of soaked ladyfingers
Top with the remaining mascarpone cream<br>
Cover and refrigerate for at least 6 hours, or ideally overnight<br>
When ready to serve, sift the cocoa powder evenly on top of the tiramisu.<br> Cut into slices and serve!</p>

  <h2><strong class="bigsteps">Vanilla cake</strong></h2>

</center>
  <p><strong class="smallsteps">Step 1</strong> :Preheat oven to 350°F</p>
   <p><strong class="smallsteps">Step 2</strong>:In a medium bowl, whisk flour, baking powder, and salt until combined. Set aside</p>
   <p><strong class="smallsteps">Step 3</strong>: Using a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (preferred) or a hand mixer, beat sugar, oil, eggs, egg whites, and extracts until combined. Add the sour cream and beat until combined. Add half of the flour mixture, beating until just combined. While still beating, slowly add milk, then the remaining flour mixture. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. Be careful not to overmix it</p>
  <p><strong class="smallsteps">Step 4</strong>: Line three 8-inch cake pans** with parchment paper and grease the pans. Evenly divide the batter between the three pans. Tap/gently drop the pans on the countertop a couple times to remove any air bubbles</p>
  <p><strong class="smallsteps">Step 5</strong>: Bake for 18-22 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. If necessary, rotate the pans once during bake time to ensure even browning. Place the pans on a rack to cool completely</p>

<center><h2><strong class="bigsteps">Filling + Frosting</strong></h2></center>
<p><strong class="smallsteps">Filling</strong>: Combine the strawberries and jam and set aside (these will be used for the filling and topping). Note: I slice the strawberries for the filling (about 2½ cups), and I diced the strawberries for the top of the cake (about ½ cup). You can slice or dice, your choice. You'll need about 3 cups total.</p>
<p><strong class="smallsteps">Frosting</strong>: Place the cream cheese, powdered sugar, and vanilla extract in a large mixing bowl. Using a stand mixer with a whisk attachment (preferred) or hand mixer, beat the mixture on medium speed until smooth. While the mixer is still whipping, slowly pour the heavy cream down the side of the bowl. Stop and scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl periodically. Increase the speed to high and continue whipping until the cream can hold a stiff peak. It is important that the cream stays cold so that it will thicken properly. If you're using a hand mixer hold the bowl near the top and don't hold the bowl against your body.</p>

<p><strong class="assombly">Assembly:</strong>
  Place one layer of cake on a platter<br>
  Top with one-third of the frosting, then top with about 1¼ cups of strawberries<br>
  Place another layer of cake on top and repeat<br>
  For the third/top of layer of cake, top with remaining whipped cream frosting, then place the remaining strawberries in the center<br>
   Decorate the outside with whole strawberries, if desired<br>
